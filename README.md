# photonmind-PIC
Accelerate the design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with machine learning.

The PhotonMind platform creates artificial neural network (ANN) models of photonic devices using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) electromagnetic data. This allows for orders-of-magnitude faster calculations for device-level optimizations and system-level simulations. The PhotonMind-PIC project aims to build a standard library of common photonic devices for open use.

## Library
PhotonMind-PIC includes a growing library of common photonic devices contained in trained ANN models. These models are given in `data.mat`.
